# FireworkSDK
FireworkSDK is a library to integrate video feeds from ```Firework - a short form video platform``` into your Android application. 

# Prerequisites 
To integrate FireworkSDK into your applicaiton, you have to register your application with Firework platform. You have to provide <package_name> of your application which can be the same as your application_id or different. Once you register your application, you will be provided with unique app_id. The unique app_id is required to authenticate client with Firework platform. Check more details about its usage in the later sections.

# How to use FireworkSDK?
FireworkSDK provides two options to integrate Firework video feed in your application and drop in your view hierarchy.
- Fragment: It provides out of box solution wrapped in Firedwork video feed fragment with limited control over UX/UI. 
- VideoView: It provides a VideoView then you can render and complete control over UX/UI by yourself.

**Fragment:**

This is the quickest and easiest way to start seeing the Firework video feed in your applicaiton. The fragment will handle initializing ```FireworkSDK```, authenticating your applicaiton with ```Firework platform``` and displaying the video feed in your application. Add the following fragment to your view hierarchy with appropriate layout parameters and attributes and its done.  
				
			<fragment android:id="@+id/{your_fragment_id}"
	   			android:name="com.loopnow.fireworklibrary.views.VideoFeedFragment"
	   			android:layout_width="{your_fragment_width}"
	   			android:layout_height="{your_fragment_height}"
	   			app:showTitle="{true / false}"
	   			app:appid="{provide_your_app_id}"
	   			app:feedLayout="{grid | horizontal | vertical}"
	  			app:columns="{number_of_columns_if_your_feedLayout_is_grid}"
	   			app:textStyle="@style/{your_text_style_for_video_title}" 
           			app:imageStyle="@style/{your_image_style_for_video_thumbnail}">
			</fragment>

1. appId: This refers to app_id you received at the time of registering your application with Firework platform. FireworkSDK will throw exception in the absense of appid. It is a compulsory attribute. 

2. feedLayout: This is an optional attribute and specifies the layout for the video feed. feedLayout can take any one of the three availavble layouts. 

* horizontal: Will layout video feed as a single row on a horizontal scrollable view. 

	<img src="screenshots/Horizontal_video_list.png"  width="270" height="480">

* vertical: Will layout video feed as a single column on a vertical scrollable view.

	<img src="screenshots/vertical.jpg"  width="270" height="480"> <img src="screenshots/vertical_with_title.jpg"  width="270" height="480">


* grid: Will layout video feed in a multiple <rows> x <columns> format scrollable vertically. If optional attribute  ```app:columns``` is not specified, the default number of columns is 2. 

	<img src="screenshots/grid.jpg"  width="270" height="480"> <img src="screenshots/grid_with_title.jpg"  width="270" height="480">


3. columns: This is an optional attribute and is only relevant if feedLayout is grid and with default columns value 2. 

4. showTitle: This is an optional attribute and can be either true or false. When true, video title is displayed below thumbnail. The default value is false and no title is displayed. The number of lines of title and the look and feel such as font, text color, and text size can be customized with optional attribute ```app:textStyle```.

5. textStyle: An optional attribute but we highly recommend you provide style for the video title if you have showTitle attribute set to true. See textStyle example as below.

```app:textStyle="@style/VideoTitleStyle"```

	<style name="VideoTitleStyle">
        	<item name="android:textColor">#ff4a4a4a</item>
        	<item name="android:textSize">14dp</item>
        	<item name="android:lines">2</item>
        	<item name="android:gravity">right</item>
        	<item name="android:layout_width">match_parent</item>
        	<item name="android:fontFamily">@font/squeakychalk</item>
   	</style>
  
Note that the value of attribute lines is also applied to maxLines. 

6. imageStyle: An optional attribute that can be used to define corner radius of the image. At present, only radius is supported. 

```app:imageStyle="@style/ThumbnailStyle"```

	<style name="ImageStyle" >
	       <item name="android:radius">12dp</item>
	</style>
	
	
**VideoView**

FireworkSDK provides view VideoView that you can embed in your view hierarchy. You can have control over player UX/UI.
VideoView provides api to pause - pause(), resume - resume(), seek -seek(milliseconds), get progress - getProgress(), set video to be played - setVideo(videoId)

If you want to use VideoView, you have to first initialize FireworkSDK and request video feed. 

	val fireworkSDK = FireworkSDK.initialize(applicationContext, appid, bundle_id, generateViewId(),
                        object : FireworkInitStatusListener {
                            override fun onInitializing() {
                                // Initializing the Firework SDK.
                            }

                            override fun onInitCompleted() {
                                // Firework SDK initialization completed.
				// Request feed here                               
                            }

                            override fun onInitFailed(error: String) {
                                // Firework SDK initialization failed.                       
                            }
                        })
			
			
As discussed earlier, you receive appId at the time of registering your application with Firework platform, bundle_id is the same as your package name specified in your AndroidManifest and provided at the time of registering your application. You also need to provide unique id, which here is created with generateViewId() but you can choose another way of creating it. The last argument is FireworkInitStatusListener. You will implement three callbacks
1. onInitializing()
2. onInitCompleted()
3. onInitFailed()

Once you initialize SDK, you can request video feed. The example below demonstrates requesting feed and setting and updating data in the adapter.  

	fireworkSDK.getVideoFeed().observe(this, Observer {
            it?.let { result ->
                when (result) {
                    is FeedResult.Loading -> {
                        // Data is being requested from server 
                    }
                    is FeedResult.Error -> {
                        // Error encountered while requesting data 
                    }
                    is FeedResult.Videos -> {
                        // Received data from server 
			// we recommend calling the following method to apply the new recommendated video list order 
                        //  fireworkSDK.preparePlayableList(adapter.videoList, result.videos, adapter.currentVideo, view_pager.offscreenPageLimit)
			
			if (adapter.videoList.size > 0) {
                            fireworkSDK.preparePlayableList(adapter.videoList, result.videos, adapter.currentVideo, view_pager.offscreenPageLimit)
                        } else {
                            if (result.videos.isNotEmpty() && adapter.currentVideo == -1) {
                                
				adapter.setData(result.videos)
                                view_pager.setCurrentItem(0, false)
                                fireworkSDK.nowPlayingVideo(0, adapter.videoList[0])                    
                            }
                        }
                        adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()
                    }
                }
            }
        })

If you are using ViewPager and PagerAdapter, you can inflate your view hierarchy that contains videoview and set video to be played using setVideo method of VideoView. Please refer to example below. This will looks different, depending on your view hierarchy. 

	override fun instantiateItem(collection: ViewGroup, position: Int): Any {
        	val video = videoList[position]
        	val inflater = LayoutInflater.from(context)
        	val layout = inflater.inflate(R.layout.playbackview_item, collection, false) as ViewGroup
        	val videoView = if(layout.childCount > 0) layout.getChildAt(0) as VideoView else null

        	videoView?.apply {
            		setVideo(video)
        	} 
        	collection.addView(layout)
        	return layout
    	}

For FireworkSDK to personalize the video recommendation, it is important to call method nowPlayingVideo of FireworkSDK. If you were using ViewPager you could do something like this - 

	view_pager.addOnPageChangeListener(object : ViewPager.OnPageChangeListener {
            override fun onPageScrollStateChanged(p0: Int) {
            }

            override fun onPageScrolled(p0: Int, p1: Float, p2: Int) {
            }

            override fun onPageSelected(p0: Int) {
                fireworkSDK.nowPlayingVideo(p0, adapter.videoList[p0])
            }
        })



# Pagination
When VideoFeedFragment is used, it handles pagination and continuously fetches feed as user scrolls. But if you choose to get raw feed and render it youself, you will have to implement pagination. 


# Video Playback
When user clicks on one of the thumbnails from the video feed integrated in your application, FireworkSDK handles the onClick event and starts the video playback. You will have to include PlaybackActivity in your AndroidManifest file. 
```<activity android:name="com.loopnow.fireworklibrary.PlaybackActivity" />```
                

# Video Playback Fragment 
In case you want to integrate full screen video playback without the video feed (thumbnails), you can add FireworkPlayerFragment to your view hierarchy. Users can swipe right to watch the next video and swipe left to watch previous video if any available. 

	<fragment android:name="com.loopnow.fireworklibrary.views.FireworkPlayerFragment"
		  android:layout_width="match_parent"
		  android:layout_height="match_parent"
		  app:appid="provide_your_app_id"
		  android:id="{your_fragment_id}">
	</fragment>
